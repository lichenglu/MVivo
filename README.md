## Introduction

If you have heard of qualitative research, then you are likely to have heard of an application called NVivo. NVivo is a great application that makes qualitative researchers' life so much easier. However, the pricing of NVivo is high and most of the time, people using NVivo mainly use NVivo's `qualitative coding` feature. So, this repo intends to offer the `qualitative coding` feature that could meet most researchers' needs.

## Version 0.1 Roadmap

You can see version 0.1's roadmap [here](https://github.com/lichenglu/MVivo/issues/4)

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcomed, though you might not know what you can do currently. But please contact me at li.chenglu@utexas.edu if you know NVivo, and would like to have a free version of it.
