## Introduction

If you have heard of qualitative research, then you are likely to have heard of an application called NVivo. NVivo is a great application that makes qualitative researchers' life so much easier. However, the pricing of NVivo is high and most of the time, people using NVivo mainly use NVivo's `qualitative coding` feature. So, this repo intends to offer the `qualitative coding` feature that could meet most researchers' needs.
