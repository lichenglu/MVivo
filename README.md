## Introduction

### Why?

If you have heard of qualitative research, then you are likely to have heard of an application called NVivo. NVivo is a great application that makes qualitative researchers' life so much easier. However, the pricing of NVivo is high and most of the time, people using NVivo mainly use NVivo's `qualitative coding` feature. So, this repo intends to offer the `qualitative coding` feature that could meet most researchers' needs.

### Features

1. Offline first. Open the web app for the first time, and you should be able to use it without any internet.
2. Select to code. Designed for qualitative research in mind.
3. Sort corpus by code.
4. Output formatted code book, APA format.

## Version 0.1 Roadmap

You can see version 0.1's roadmap [here](https://github.com/lichenglu/MVivo/issues/4)

## Development

Currently, it is quite straightforward, as I have not introduced the backend part to the repo.

```
cd to PROJECT-DIR
npm i
npm start
```

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcomed, though you might not know what you can do currently. But please contact me at li.chenglu@utexas.edu if you know NVivo, and would like to have a free version of it.
